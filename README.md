A modern ERP dashboard built with **Python**, **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL** and **Streamlit**.

This project combines a REST API backend, a relational PostgreSQL database and a modern Streamlit frontend for managing master data, purchasing, sales, exports and reporting.

---

## ✨ Overview

**Compu-Global-Hyper-Meganet ERP** is a lightweight business management system created as a full-stack database project.

The application demonstrates how backend APIs, database structures and an interactive frontend can work together in a practical ERP scenario. It includes core ERP features such as customer and supplier management, product data, purchase orders, invoices, exports and business reporting.

The user interface was redesigned with a clean and modern dashboard layout to make the project suitable for a professional GitHub and portfolio presentation.

## 🎓 Project Background

This ERP system was originally developed as a school project during my training program at **COMCAVE College**, in cooperation with **Enders Training**.

For my personal learning goals and portfolio, I redesigned and extended the project further. This included improving the user interface, modernizing the Streamlit frontend, refining the project presentation and expanding the overall look and feel of the application.

The project therefore represents both the original educational assignment and my own continued development work. My goal was to turn the basic project into a more polished and portfolio-ready full-stack application.

## 🖥️ Preview

The frontend was redesigned with a modern dashboard style, custom sidebar navigation, clean KPI cards, page-specific browser tab titles and improved visual structure across all pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

---

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

**Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Configure environment variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

Then update the database credentials inside `.env.development`:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=erp
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
API_URL=http://localhost:8000
KLINIK_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

---

### 5. Set up the PostgreSQL database

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.

Then execute the SQL setup file:

```bash
psql -U postgres -f erp_setup.sql
```

This creates the required database structure and inserts sample data.

---

### 6. Start the FastAPI backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.api:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Interactive API documentation:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

### 7. Start the Streamlit frontend

Open a second terminal and run:

```bash
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

The frontend will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```
